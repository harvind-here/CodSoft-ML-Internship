# Machine Learning Projects Repository #
#### Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed during my internship at CodSoft in the ML domain. Each project focuses on solving different real-world problems using various machine learning techniques and algorithms.

## Projects Overview:
1. SMS Spam Detection:
Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam).
Techniques Used: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Classification Algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
2. Movie Genre Recommendation:
Objective: The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.
Techniques Used: Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Content-Based Filtering, Recommendation Algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes).
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection:
Objective: This project aims to develop a model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.
Techniques Used: Anomaly Detection, Imbalanced Data Handling, Feature Engineering, Classification Algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine).

## Repository Structure:
SMS_Spam_Detection: Contains code and resources related to the SMS spam detection project.
Movie_Genre_Recommendation: Includes notebooks and data files for the movie genre recommendation project.
Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection: Contains scripts and datasets for the credit card fraud detection project.
Documentation: Additional documentation, reports, and resources related to the projects, such as ReadMe file.
